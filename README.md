# Pre-Anesthesia-Test-App

Pre-Operative Anesthesia Recommendation App  
• During my internship, I worked where anesthesiologists are facing difficulties in retrieving patient histories before 
surgeries, leading to delays most of the times. So, I collaborated with medical professionals to work on this issue 
to analyze workflow gaps and designed an Android & web-based solution to streamline patient data access. 
• The first challenge was ensuring real-time data availability. Using Firebase for cloud synchronization and MySQL 
for structured storage, I built a responsive backend. React.js was incorporated for the web interface. 
• Handling sensitive patient data meant security was a priority. I implemented SHA-256 encryption for credential 
storage and role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized access.  
• Automated Bash scripts monitored log files for potential security breaches. 
• Doctors needed quick insights rather than complex systems. I designed a simple, Figma-based UI with minimal 
clicks for patient retrieval. Backend queries were optimized using PL/SQL, reducing patient record loading time. 
• The system underwent testing using JUnit and Postman. conducted live testing with anesthesiologists, gathering 
feedback to refine features. Security audits using PowerShell scripts ensured compliance with medical standards. 
• The final application reduced pre-operative delays and improved efficiency in patient risk assessments. Post
deployment feedback was highly positive, and the project demonstrated how technology can directly enhance 
medical decision-making in real-world scenarios.
